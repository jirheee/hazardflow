# Introduction

HazardFlow HDL allows users to describe pipelined circuits with hazards modularly at the cycle level accuracy.
HazardFlow HDL provides hazard interfaces, which internalize pipeline-backward dependencies into a resolver signal within the interfaces, and combinators for interfaces, designed in a map-reduce style to facilitate the decomposition of pipelined circuits.
By the end, you should be able to design your hardware modules with HazardFlow HDL and compile them into Verilog.
